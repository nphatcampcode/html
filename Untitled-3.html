        <p>I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
            I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
            I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
            I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
            I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
            But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
            Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
            When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
            (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
            When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
            We're stressed out
            Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
            How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
            I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
            Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
            It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
            Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
            But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
            Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
            My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
            Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
            When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
            (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
            When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
            We used to play pretend, give each other different names
            We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
            Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
            Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah
            We used to play pretend, give each other different names
            We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
            Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
            Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah
            Wish we could turn back time, to the good old days
            When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
            (Oh) Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
            When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
            Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
            We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
            Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
            We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
            Used to play pretend, give each other different names
            We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
            Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face
            Saying, "Wake up, you need to make money, " yeah
